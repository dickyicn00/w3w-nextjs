# W3W | Builders Convention Focused on Web3
Hi. I'm is W3W theme or Builders Convention Focused on Web3, if you will. I am a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as Parent Theme. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

A modern workflow with a pre-made command-line interface to turn your project into a more pleasant experience.
A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
Flexible and modern CSS framework, which uses tailwind css
Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

# Next + Netlify Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases. With Netlify, you'll have access to features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Netlify Functions, and internationalized routing on deploy automatically.

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)
